## About me

I'm a studied engineer with a passion for Linux computers. I can't stop myself
from poking around in systems and I hardly ever take the shortest path to get
where I want. I think that's learning.


## What I do

Various things, but preferrably:

1. [Open Source Development][b1] in every shade and color (also check out my
   [contributions to other projects][b5])
1. [Automation][b2], mostly using [scripts][b3], to eliminate humans (and human
   errors) from repetitive processes
1. [Containerize all the things][b4], because "Works on my machine" is a
   horrible developer and user experience in my opinion
1. Write the docs, because someone has to do it and I can't stand googling for
   answers

Also take a look at [my GitLab profile][01] to see what else I work on.
